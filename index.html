		<p>   Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.[1]

For educators and researchers, reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition, orthography (spelling), alphabetics, phonics, phonemic awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and motivation.[2][3]

Other types of reading and writing, such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji), are not based on speech based writing systems.[4] The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </p>
